## Audience Analysis

The primary audience for the Fundraiser Toolkit Website is volunteers and staff at small nonprofit organizations who are responsible for planning fundraising events. These individuals are deeply committed to their causes but often have limited training, resources, or time to devote to event planning. Many juggle multiple responsibilities—family, work, and community involvement—and rely heavily on informal tools, ad‑hoc processes, and personal networks to get things done. Their needs, constraints, and motivations shaped the structure and content of the toolkit.

### Primary Audience: Volunteer Event Planners at Small Nonprofits

Interviews with a diverse group of community volunteers revealed several consistent themes:

- Little to no formal training in event planning  
- Limited budgets and minimal access to professional tools  
- High logistical burden, including coordinating venues, marketing, RSVPs, donations, and volunteers  
- Difficulty staying organized without checklists or timelines  
- Anxiety about “doing it right” and fear of missing important steps  
- Preference for simple, beginner‑friendly guidance and templates  
- Need for tools that work on both desktop and mobile devices  

These insights helped us design a toolkit that is approachable, supportive, and tailored to the realities of small nonprofit work.

### Secondary Audiences

Secondary audiences include caseworkers, social workers, and community organizers who may use the toolkit to support volunteers or share resources with partner organizations. While not the primary users, they benefit from having a centralized, credible resource to recommend.

### Persona: Hana Everest

To synthesize our research, we developed a persona representing a typical user: **Hana**, a stay‑at‑home mom and Friends of the Library volunteer who organizes events out of passion for her community. Hana is motivated, caring, and eager to help—but she is also overwhelmed, unsure where to start, and anxious about making mistakes. She wants simple, trustworthy guidance, editable templates, and tools that fit her limited time and budget.

Hana’s persona helped us focus on designing a site that feels welcoming, beginner‑friendly, and immediately useful.

### Empathy Map Insights

Our empathy map highlighted several emotional and practical realities:

- **Says:** “Where do I even start?” “I just want something simple that works.”  
- **Thinks:** “I hope I’m doing this right.” “Is this made for someone like me?”  
- **Does:** Searches Google, asks friends for help, jumps between tasks, works late  
- **Feels:** Overwhelmed, nervous, determined, grateful when someone makes things easier  

These insights reinforced the need for clear navigation, supportive tone, and ready‑to‑use templates.

### Journey Map Insights

Mapping Hana’s journey—from discovering the site to implementing its tools—revealed several opportunities:

- A **“Start Here”** section to orient beginners  
- Clear labels such as **“For Beginners”** or **“No Budget Required”**  
- Editable templates in familiar formats (Google Docs, Canva, PDFs)  
- Short “How to Use This” explanations  
- Mobile‑friendly design for volunteers working on the go  

These findings guided the structure of the toolkit and the prioritization of content.
