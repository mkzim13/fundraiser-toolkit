# Fundraiser Toolkit Website — Project Narrative

## Instructional Problem

Small nonprofit organizations often rely on fundraising events to sustain their programs, yet many lack the time, staff capacity, or technical expertise to plan these events effectively. The goal of this project was to create a clear, accessible website toolkit that would guide nonprofits through the essential steps of planning a successful fundraising event. The toolkit needed to be practical, easy to navigate, and built around free or low‑cost tools so that organizations with limited budgets could use it immediately.

## Project Background and Scope

The project began with a much broader concept: developing a website about 3D printing. Early in the process, however, our team recognized that the topic was too ambitious given our timeline and skill set. This realization prompted a strategic pivot toward a more focused and achievable goal—supporting nonprofits in planning fundraising events.

Refining the scope allowed us to concentrate on a specific audience with clear needs. We centered the toolkit on small nonprofits that may not have dedicated event staff or technical resources. Our research emphasized simple planning strategies, accessible templates, and free digital tools that organizations could adopt without financial strain.

## Audience Analysis

Our primary audience consisted of staff and volunteers at small nonprofit organizations. These individuals often juggle multiple responsibilities and may have limited experience with event planning. Key audience characteristics included:

- Limited time and capacity, requiring concise, actionable guidance  
- Minimal technical expertise, necessitating a simple, intuitive website  
- Small or nonexistent budgets, making free tools and low‑cost strategies essential  
- A need for confidence and clarity, especially when planning events for the first time  

Because our timeline did not allow for extensive audience research, we made informed assumptions based on common nonprofit constraints. This experience reinforced the importance of defining a narrow, realistic audience early in the design process.

## Team Collaboration

The project was completed by a four‑person team: Aditi, Dane, Janelle, and Marc. Strong communication and complementary strengths were central to our success. We held weekly virtual meetings, shared documents, and maintained an active group chat to coordinate tasks and support one another.

Each team member contributed uniquely:

- **Aditi** conducted research and drafted clear, factual content, bringing a fresh perspective as someone new to fundraising.  
- **Dane** contributed to writing and technical decisions, advocating for free tools and ensuring the content remained approachable.  
- **Janelle** kept the team organized by taking notes, tracking progress, and helping with planning despite a demanding schedule.  
- **Marc** provided early guidance that helped refine the project scope and ensured the team’s goals remained realistic and achievable.  

The collaborative environment was one of the most meaningful aspects of the project. Beyond task coordination, the team built rapport, shared personal updates, and supported one another through challenges.

## Tools Used

We initially explored WordPress as a platform for the toolkit but found the learning curve too steep for the project timeline. We ultimately selected **Google Sites**, which offered a more intuitive interface and allowed us to focus on content quality rather than technical setup. Google Sites enabled real‑time collaboration, easy page‑level navigation, and straightforward integration of links and resources. Its simplicity made it an ideal choice for producing a clean, functional toolkit within our constraints.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

Time was the most significant constraint. With limited hours for research, we had to make educated assumptions about our audience and prioritize essential content. This experience underscored several key lessons:

- A focused scope leads to a stronger deliverable. Narrowing the topic early allowed us to produce something polished and useful.  
- Audience clarity drives better decisions. Understanding who we were designing for helped us choose appropriate tools, tone, and content.  
- Communication is critical. Regular check‑ins, flexibility, and mutual support kept the project on track.

## Reflection

The Fundraiser Toolkit Website represents a practical, accessible resource for nonprofits that need help planning fundraising events. It also reflects the strengths of our team—adaptability, collaboration, and a commitment to producing something meaningful within our constraints. The project reinforced core principles of technical communication: define your audience, keep the scope manageable, iterate collaboratively, and design with usability in mind.
